        <u><b><i>YouTube and Taboola: Defining the Future of Digital Video</i></b></u>\n\nEarly last month, I was asked to head out to Singapore for a one-day conference organized by IAB SEA + India called Tomorrow’s Digital Skills Today.\nI spoke about video creative and production from the psychological, data and research points of view, and although traveling there wasn’t easy (I flew 16 hours each way for a 48 hour stay)—I would definitely say it was worth it.\nAside from enjoying the modern city, delicious foods, and warm weather (not to mention a quick drink at the world famous Marina Bay Sands hotel rooftop), I also had the pleasure to co-present with Karl Duffill, Regional Agency Business Head at Google, who was asked to speak about video creatives as well.\nWhen preparing for this session, we found that although Taboola and Google are two different video platforms that give consumers a different experience, even when watching the same video, many of the video trends and recommendations regarding the video creative are similar: authenticity, keeping the viewer’s attention span in mind, inspiring the audience to take action, and more.\n
              \n  <u><b><i>Authenticity in video drives success.</i></b></u>\n
        YouTube has been identifying some really interesting trends in regards to video formats.\n
People aren’t just watching videos with traditional storylines anymore—they’re spending hours watching gamers just play online games, they’re watching a lot of super short videos, and they’re especially loving live-streamed content.\n
One of the things that these trends have in common is authenticity.\n
        The person recording himself playing a video game did not prepare a script for if he wins or when he loses.\n
